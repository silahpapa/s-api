# Axios Wrapper NPM Package

This is an NPM package that provides a wrapper for Axios HTTP client.
It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to your API backend and adding authorization headers to your requests.

### Installation
 To use s-apis in your project, install it via npm:
####

`$ npm i s-apis`


Usage
Import the functions you need from the package:
###
`import { doGet, doPost, doPut, doPatch, doDelete } from 's-apis'`

Then, simply call the function you need

The functions return a Promise that resolves to an AxiosResponse object, so you can access the response data and status code.

## Authorization
s-apis supports authorization headers using access tokens. 
To use this feature, simply include the token in local storage under 
the key access_token. s-apis will automatically add the header to all requests that require authentication.

#### Examples　

GET request 
#####
Example using doGet
```
doGet('/users/1')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
